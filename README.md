# Organism

Create an "organism" in Processing that will interact and respond to input.

# Examples

## A_basic_motion

Set a function to draw the basic organism at given coordinates. Create movement based on `frameCount` using `sin`.

## B_basic_interaction

Almost the same as `basic_motion` example, but demonstrates how to use mouse position to move the organism.

## C_basic_interaction_follow

Also very similar, but adds an easing effect to the organism movement.

## D_basic_events

Used keyboard and mouse events to modify display.

## E_leap_motion

Uses leap motion sensor to control organism position and rotation.

**NOTE:** Requires a Leap Motion sensor and the [Leap Motion Library for Processing](https://github.com/nok/leap-motion-processing).
